# RFM-Analysis-with-KMeans-Clustering
## What does RFM Mean?
Recency means the number of days since a customer made the last purchase.
Frequency is the number of purchase in a given period. It could be 3 months, 6 months or 1 year. Monetary is the total amount of money a customer spent in that given period.
Therefore, big spenders will be differentiated among other customers such as MVP (Minimum Viable Product) or VIP.
## Task in Hand
Perform cohort analysis (a cohort is a group of subjects that share a defining characteristic).
Create month cohorts and analyze active customers for each cohort.
Analyze the retention rate of customers.
Build RFM Segments. Give recency, frequency, and monetary scores individually by dividing them into quartiles.
Perform customer segmentation using RFM analysis and Kmeans.
